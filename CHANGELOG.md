# 0.2.2

* Fix running dmenv on Windows
* The configuration file is now read from $HOME (`~/.config` on Linux and macOS, `%HOME%\AppData\Local` on Windows).

# 0.2.1

The `.dmenv.toml` file is now required. No need to guess, and once it exists it's easier
to edit it later. No need to re-read the doc :)

# 0.2.0

Can be used with multiple python versions, using the `.dmenv.toml` config file.

# 0.1.0

Initial release.
